Make sure to subscribe :) also congrats to Mr Beast on 100 million!!!In this challenge, the pot starts at 1 million dollars and it goes down $69 every 1 second. When I beat the game, the money that's left is given away to a RANDOM SUBSCRIBER! So make sure to subscribe! There's a catch though. If I don't beat the game quick enough, the money goes into the negatives, and that's how much I have to pay my 3 friends that are hunting me down!It's a race, and it's super intense and we had a lot of laughs. I love doing these challenges.If this video gets 1,000,000 likes, I might try and convince someone else to do it! Not Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises, or any other but challenge like that. This is a speed run / speed runner of Minecraft against a killer / assassin#MrBeastHunt"

After edging his way into the box, his low cross was parried by Bono into the path of the onrushing Jesus, who had the simple task of tucking the chance away.And after giving the majority of supporters their first glimpse of his famous telephone celebration in Arsenal colours, he was at it again two minutes later. Again the threat came down the left but this time through Gabriel Martinelli, and with the Sevilla defence sleeping, a teasing cross allowed Jesus to race in behind and dispatch the delivery into the net.Sevilla had completely lost their heads, and that was typified by our fourth goal. A routine pass back to Bono saw the goalkeeper fluff a weak clearance straight to Saka, whose first-time effort trickled through the shot-stopper’s legs to cap off an incredible start.Glee was spreading around the stadium, and none more so than on the pitch, with Arteta’s team producing plenty of slick passing and looking threatening every time they entered the final third.During a couple of rare forays forward for the visitors in the first half, Youssef En-Nesyri flashed a shot just wide before heading straight at Aaron Ramsdale - a feat Thomas Partey repeated following a corner, before a remarkable half ended with Bono clawing back some redemption by making a double save to deny both Jesus and Odegaard, and then denying Martinelli one-on-one.It was a much tighter affair immediately after the break, with Rekik heading a corner just wide 10 minutes after the restart, but we were working through the gears again and after Jesus dragged an attempt from 25 yards wide, Oleksandr Zinchenko picked out Odegaard in the box but he blasted over.Midway through the second half there was almost a delightful goal to cheer when Partey chipped a ball over the backline for Xhaka, and his side-footed volley narrowly missed the top corner, but on 77 minutes the long wait for another goal ended.A Martinelli corner caused havoc as Gabriel forced Bono into a close-range save, but Jesus was on hand to drive home the rebound, complete his treble and register his seventh goal in just five pre-season outings.White almost put the cap on the result when a clever free-kick routine saw him attempt to lob Bono but it drifted wide, but in the final minute a sixth was added when Xhaka showed good skill to play in Martinelli, and after carrying the ball 40 yards the Brazilian unselfishly squared to Nketiah to complete the rout.The final whistle was greeted with rapturous applause by those in attendance, who stayed to watch Odegaard get his hands on the Emirates Cup trophy to mark our sixth triumph in the competition’s history.Enjoy match highlights, training and behind the scenes to get closer to the likes of Bukayo Saka, Emile Smith Rowe, Gabriel Jesus, Vivianne Miedema, Nicolas Pepe, Leah Williamson, Bernd Leno, Nikita Parris, Mana Iwabuchi, Jordan Nobbs, Takehiro Tomiyasu, Kim Little, Gabriel Martinelli, Aaron Ramsdale, Beth Mead, Ben White, Thomas Partey and more.Subscribe to the Official Arsenal YouTube Channel: https://arsn.al/youtubeFollow us on Facebook: https://arsn.al/facebookFollow us on Twitter: https://arsn.al/twitterFollow us on Instagram: https://arsn.al/instagramFollow us on TikTok: https://arsn.al/tiktok"

Why? They were filled with a vaccine to fight the deadliest virus known to humanity – since the 1930s a rabies epidemic had been sweeping across wildlife populations in Europe and humans wanted to finally get rid of the virus once and for all. Rabies is named after Lyssa, the ancient Greek spirit of mad rage, and has been haunting us for at least 4000 years. It can turn animals into angry beasts and humans into zombies that fear water. But what makes Lyssa fascinating is not just how bizarre and deadly its infection is, but also how incredibly good it is at avoiding our defenses.OUR CHANNELS▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀German:        https://kgs.link/youtubeDESpanish:        https://kgs.link/youtubeESFrench:          https://kgs.link/youtubeFRPortuguese:  https://kgs.link/youtubePTArabic:           https://kgs.link/youtubeARHindi:             https://kgs.link/youtubeHIJapanese:     https://kgs.link/youtubeJAKorean:          https://kgs.link/youtubeKOHOW CAN YOU SUPPORT US?▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀This is how we make our living and it would be a pleasure if you support us!Get Merch designed with ❤ https://shop-us.kurzgesagt.org  Join the Patreon Bird Army 🐧  https://kgs.link/patreon  DISCUSSIONS & SOCIAL MEDIA▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀Reddit:            https://kgs.link/redditInstagram:     https://kgs.link/instagramTwitter:           https://kgs.link/twitterFacebook:      https://kgs.link/facebookDiscord:          https://kgs.link/discordNewsletter:    https://kgs.link/newsletterOUR VOICE▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀The Kurzgesagt voice is from Steve Taylor:  https://kgs.link/youtube-voiceOUR MUSIC ♬♪▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀700+ minutes of Kurzgesagt Soundtracks by Epic Mountain:Spotify:            https://kgs.link/music-spotifySoundcloud:   https://kgs.link/music-soundcloudBandcamp:     https://kgs.link/music-bandcampYoutube:          https://kgs.link/music-youtubeFacebook:       https://kgs.link/music-facebookThe Soundtrack of this video:Soundcloud: https://bit.ly/3ow2RmaBandcamp: https://bit.ly/3b88SCbIf you want to help us caption this video, please send subtitles to subtitle@kurzgesagt.orgYou can find info on what subtitle files work on YouTube here:https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2734698?hl=en-GB&ref_topic=7296214Thank you!🐦🐧🐤 PATREON BIRD ARMY 🐤🐧🐦▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀Many Thanks to our wonderful Patreons (from http://kgs.link/patreon) who support us every month and made this video possible:Daniel Schilling, Jacob, Eui-seong Kim, Lucas Pastorfield-Li, Bryan Cain, Tommy Etkin, Matko Stokov, Wilson, Tsuseki, Hany Abdulsamad, Scentynelle, N.
