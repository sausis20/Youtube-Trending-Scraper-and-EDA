After edging his way into the box, his low cross was parried by Bono into the path of the onrushing Jesus, who had the simple task of tucking the chance away.And after giving the majority of supporters their first glimpse of his famous telephone celebration in Arsenal colours, he was at it again two minutes later. Again the threat came down the left but this time through Gabriel Martinelli, and with the Sevilla defence sleeping, a teasing cross allowed Jesus to race in behind and dispatch the delivery into the net.Sevilla had completely lost their heads, and that was typified by our fourth goal. A routine pass back to Bono saw the goalkeeper fluff a weak clearance straight to Saka, whose first-time effort trickled through the shot-stopper‚Äôs legs to cap off an incredible start.Glee was spreading around the stadium, and none more so than on the pitch, with Arteta‚Äôs team producing plenty of slick passing and looking threatening every time they entered the final third.During a couple of rare forays forward for the visitors in the first half, Youssef En-Nesyri flashed a shot just wide before heading straight at Aaron Ramsdale - a feat Thomas Partey repeated following a corner, before a remarkable half ended with Bono clawing back some redemption by making a double save to deny both Jesus and Odegaard, and then denying Martinelli one-on-one.It was a much tighter affair immediately after the break, with Rekik heading a corner just wide 10 minutes after the restart, but we were working through the gears again and after Jesus dragged an attempt from 25 yards wide, Oleksandr Zinchenko picked out Odegaard in the box but he blasted over.Midway through the second half there was almost a delightful goal to cheer when Partey chipped a ball over the backline for Xhaka, and his side-footed volley narrowly missed the top corner, but on 77 minutes the long wait for another goal ended.A Martinelli corner caused havoc as Gabriel forced Bono into a close-range save, but Jesus was on hand to drive home the rebound, complete his treble and register his seventh goal in just five pre-season outings.White almost put the cap on the result when a clever free-kick routine saw him attempt to lob Bono but it drifted wide, but in the final minute a sixth was added when Xhaka showed good skill to play in Martinelli, and after carrying the ball 40 yards the Brazilian unselfishly squared to Nketiah to complete the rout.The final whistle was greeted with rapturous applause by those in attendance, who stayed to watch Odegaard get his hands on the Emirates Cup trophy to mark our sixth triumph in the competition‚Äôs history.Enjoy match highlights, training and behind the scenes to get closer to the likes of Bukayo Saka, Emile Smith Rowe, Gabriel Jesus, Vivianne Miedema, Nicolas Pepe, Leah Williamson, Bernd Leno, Nikita Parris, Mana Iwabuchi, Jordan Nobbs, Takehiro Tomiyasu, Kim Little, Gabriel Martinelli, Aaron Ramsdale, Beth Mead, Ben White, Thomas Partey and more.Subscribe to the Official Arsenal YouTube Channel: https://arsn.al/youtubeFollow us on Facebook: https://arsn.al/facebookFollow us on Twitter: https://arsn.al/twitterFollow us on Instagram: https://arsn.al/instagramFollow us on TikTok: https://arsn.al/tiktok"

Dans l'immobilier, il faut privil√©gier le c√¥t√© pratique sans oublier le c√¥t√© esth√©tique. Actuellement chez moi, c'est l'entrep√¥t du bricoleur, il y a beaucoup de choses ! Je garde pas mal de chose de mon enfance, sauf mes Barbies, elles sont toutes parties √† la poubelle!‚û°Ô∏è  Ma marque de v√™tement: https://electricsugar.co/Je vais r√©nover toutes les pi√®ces de mon appartement au Canada, de l'entr√©e au salon √† ma chambre et mon studio de tournage.La plupart de mon mobilier vient de chez Ikea et j'ai fais beaucoup de DIY √©galement.Je vais tenter de bricoler pour que je puisse me sentir √† l'aise dans mon appartement et l'appeler enfin mon chez moi. J'adore r√©nover en g√©n√©ral, en fait, j'adore l'immobilier et l'id√©e d'aider les gens √† trouver la maison de leur r√™ve est g√©niale, je trouve! Se loger de nos jours ce n'est pas si facile en France, quelques fois, il est plus facile de louer que d'acheter. Les banques comme le Bnp Paribas ou la Banque Populaire sont des banques qui peuvent aider √† l'achat d'un bien immobilier par exemple.Et je commence √† m'int√©resser √† investir dans l'immobilier pour en faire des immeubles a logement locatif ou encore les transformer en Airbnb, j'adorerai faire vivre des exp√©riences √† autrui.D√©m√©nager et changer de logement, c'est comme un nouveau d√©part. Sur le site web Leboncoin ou Facebook Market, vous pouvez trouver pas mal de logements √† louer ou √† acheter entre particuliers si vous ne souhaitez pas passer par des agences comme Century21. Pour ma part mon style de d√©co change, j'ai besoin de me renouveler. C'est comme la mode, un coup, on s'habille chez Zara, H&M et quand on peut pourquoi pas la haute couture comme Gucci ou Chanel? Le but de cette vid√©o n'est pas de passer dans le magasine Grazia ou Vogue plut√¥t de concurrencer Val√©rie Damidot.Gr√¢ce √† mon iPhone 13 d‚ÄôApple, j'ai pu me filmer pendant plusieurs heures en train de r√©nover mon appartement et on me suivra avec la cam√©ra Lumix Panasonic GH5 (pas encore la GH6) pour prendre les vid√©os et photos cl√©s de cette exp√©rience. C'est une exp√©rience unique de ma vie quotidienne que j'ai envie de vivre avec vous !   Ensemble, on va re-d√©couvrir mon appartement et pourquoi pas refaire un room-tour √† la fin pour faire tout d√©couvrir d'un seul coup. J'ai h√¢te d'avoir vos avis sur les r√©seaux et lire vos commentaires sur YouTube.-------‚û°Ô∏è  Si tu as lu jusqu'ici, √©cris LE LAMA S'APPELLE.... en commentaires.-------DENYZEE, c'est une cha√Æne Youtube humour, des sketchs comiques de divertissement qui propose des d√©fis/challenge et exp√©riences sociales.J‚Äôimite bien l‚Äôaccent qu√©b√©cois aussi.-------Rejoins-moi sur:Facebook: http://bit.ly/denyzeefacebookInstagram : https://www.instagram.com/denyzee_Twitter : https://twitter.com/denyzee_TikTok : https://bit.ly/TikTokDenyzee"

A product of the millennial generation, his appreciation of new technology blends with his old-fashioned work ethic, and he offers a unique ability to deliver his message in a way that resonates with lifelong farmers as well as those with no knowledge of agriculture. With growing consumer awareness about where their food comes from, Zach has identified the need for an independent voice from the front lines of agriculture. Zach actively promotes agriculture by sharing his day-to-day experiences in the agriculture world while providing farmer-to-farmer education to help facilitate a collaborative conversation between farmers and the public.
